### Scene

The cat has expanded its empire, beware.

### Issues

Due to time limitiation, the mountain peaks are hard-coded.

Beer's law was implemented incorrectly in the final version image, however, an un-anti-aliased version which is correct is included under `screenshot-dark.png`

### Objectives:

-   Cylinders
-   Texture mapping
-   Bump mapping
-   Adaptive anti-aliasing
-   Phong shading
-   Glossy refraction / reflection
-   Mirror reflection
-   L-system trees
-   Fractal mountain generation
-   Nice Scene

### Extra

-   Beer's Law
