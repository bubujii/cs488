The program can be called one layer outside of the Assets directory as well

## Manual

### Extra feature

Refraction: at the moment, a "transparent material will not cast shadows because it looks better that way - it's technically a bug right now but I like the look more for my final scene.

### Code referenced / used

The following guides were followed for intersect code:

### Scene

The scene is meant to be a little bit vaporwave looking with the colours. Obviously the almighty glass cat rules all.
